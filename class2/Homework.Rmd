## 1. R Markdown example

Create an R Markdown file for the code in HW1 Problem 3. The aim of this excercise to create a simple one page report which has a few lines of text about AQI values in zipcode 20871 (or another of of your choice), a table showing the AQI values by date and a plot (same as in HW1 Problem 3).
